Hi! I am Najiya Fatma. I graduated with a Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering in June 2024 from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), under the guidance of Prof. [Varun Ramamohan](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~varunr/). My Ph.D. research focused on studying patients' healthcare-seeking behavior and modeling different patient diversion mechanisms across Indian public healthcare facilities that utilize real-time delay predictions and length of stay (LOS) predictions using analytical and simulation cum machine-learning-based predictors. 

During my Ph.D., I also worked on projects aimed at improving healthcare delivery operations (real-time delay prediction for kidney transplantation systems) and military operations (dynamic route planning for combat aircraft).

Please refer to my [curriculum vitae](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xsk0nvcldQVAhom8ZkF6-xZK-C1y5Z4S/view?usp=sharing) to get more details about my academic journey so far.
